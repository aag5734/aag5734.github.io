**A Discord bot that uses ChatGPT to provide responsive solutions and engage in discourse with Discord community members. Additionally, Nano facilitates the capability to assign member role assignments among other functionalities.**

This project started out as a fun little joke among friends, but I have since expanded its scope to enhance its
functionality.

NanoBot is constructed using Javascript and its corresponding DiscordJS libraries.
