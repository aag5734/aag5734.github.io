**A secure messaging platform that enables users to transmit and receive messages through a command-line interface, utilizing robust RSA key encryption.**

Using the principles of RSA key encryption, I have built a command line application that's built in .NET 6.0 where users are able
to create public and private keys, send these keys to a database, retrieve public keys from other users, send messages to users,
and retrieve messages from their inbox. 

More information on RSA key generation can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
