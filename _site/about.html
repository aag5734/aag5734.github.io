<p><em>4th Year Computer Science @ Rochester Institute of Technology</em>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>My name is Abraham Hernandez (formally Gonzalez). I am a Spanish-American pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with an interest in Artificial Intelligence. I was raised in San Rafael, California where I developed a love of Computer Science and a resulting passion for the technologies that have spawned from it.</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>I have ample experience in multiple programming languages and technologies. These include but are not limited to, Java, C, C#, Python, React, Angular, .NET, and REST. Moreover, I have hands-on experience developing software, managing databases, and Agile/Scrum work methodologies. More information on how these languages and frameworks have been applied can be found on the homepage.</p>

<h2 id="my-goals">My Goals</h2>

<p>One of my goals is to deliver aid in the form of educating students (both young and older) to prepare them for their future careers. Growing up where I did, there were hardly any programs available to help me in learning more about the field of Computer Science. I want to ensure that students get the help and aid that they deserve so that they can grow to become strong coders in the future.</p>

<p>Moreover, I want to succeed as a computer scientist so that I can guarantee my mother a long and healthy life as well as pay for my younger sisterâ€™s college tuition and healthcare treatment.</p>

<p>This site is still under development. Major changes are in the works!</p>
