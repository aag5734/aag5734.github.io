_3rd Year Computer Science @ Rochester Institute of Technology_.

## About me #

My name is Abraham Hernandez (formally Gonzalez) and I prefer to be referred to 
as Abe. I am a Spanish-American pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with a 
particular focus on Artificial Intelligence. I was raised in San Rafael, California
where I have developed a strong foundation in Computer Science principles and a passion
for emerging technologies.  

## Experience #

I possess proficiency in a multitude of programming languages, including Java,
C, C#, Python, and Ruby, and have hands on experience with database management,
genetic algorithms, and Agile/Scrum work methodologies. My expertise in these 
areas have been honed through my work experience and a deep understanding of 
software development principles. 

This site is still under development. Major changes are in the works!
