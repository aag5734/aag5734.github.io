## iDTech Camp Counselor Co-Op #
#### 05/2023 - CURRENT #

Taught students a plethora of different languages and their applications, mostly using Java and Python. These concepts ranged in difficulty: from basic Python concepts such as classes and inheritence to more advanced subjects such as artifical intelligence, neural networking, and game development with Java.

## Supplemental Instruction Leader #
#### 08/2021 - CURRENT # 

Facilitate weekly 1 hour sessions between classes that help students to better 
understand computer science courses. Develop and create unique coding exercises, 
lectures, and assignments throughout sessions that mirror the degree of difficulty 
and relevancy to the current course using languages such as Java, Python, and C. 
Previously supported Computer Science 1 and Problem Solving & Software Development II; 
currently supporting The Mechanics of Programming.

## Student Grader #
#### 08/2021 - 08/2022 # 

Graded and evaluated computer science assignments submitted by students on a weekly 
basis from courses that were personally previously taken. Assignments ranged in both 
difficulty and coding languages. Examples include making a Python program that 
simulates a railway system using queues and threads as well as creating a C program 
that replicates the basic functions of a social media platform while managing memory storage.

## Summer Camp Counselor #
#### 09/2016 - 05/2017 # 

Worked with a team of college students to create and organize educational and extracurricular 
activities for students from grades 1-5. Worked personally with students to help them with 
their reading and math skills. Facilitated hour-long meetings before the start of each day 
where employees would discuss activity ideas, how to manage the time for the day, and how to 
improve the program.
