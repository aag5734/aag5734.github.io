Using both JavaScript and Python, along with agile and scrum methodologies, planned and implemented automated data processing workflows using a combination of open-source tools and proprietary software. Programmed templates for variable data printing and developed Python scripts to clean and prepare data for marketing campaigns. Also responsible for overseeing the daily operation of these workflows in a hybrid Windows and Linux environment.

## Artificial Inteligence Instructor #
#### 05/2023 - 08/2023 #

Taught students at prestigious universities the concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Covered subjects such as dense and convolutional neural networks, computer vision, and deep learning. Demonstrated the process of building, training, and evaluating neural networks for image recognition projects, along with teaching how to import custom datasets using Python and tools like TensorFlow and Keras. Showed leadership skills by collaborating with fellow instructors and effectively communicated through lectures and engaging with parents.

## Supplemental Instruction Leader #
#### 08/2021 - CURRENT # 

Facilitate 1 hour weekly sessions to help students better understand the topics covered in historically difficult computer science courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Develop unique coding exercises, lectures, and assignments meant to reflect the degree of difficulty of the courses. Programming languages used included Python, Java, and C. Communicated with professors to discuss ideal lecturing techniques and analyze course statistics.

## Teacher Assistant #
#### 08/2021 - 08/2022 # 

Graded and evaluated computer science assignments submitted by students every week from the Computer Science 1 and 2
courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Assignments ranged in both difficulty and coding languages; examples
include a Python program that simulated a railway system using queues and threads as well as a C program 
that replicated the basic functions of a social media platform while managing memory storage. Provided timely 
feedback to students where I discussed how they could improve in terms of their memory usage, runtime, code structure and documentation.

## Summer Camp Counselor #
#### 09/2016 - 05/2017 # 

Participated in the development and coordination of educational and extracurricular activities aimed at elementary
school students in my local community. Duties included helping students with their reading and math skills, organizing
outdoor activities, and facilitating daily hour-long meetings. In these meetings, we discussed activity ideas, the
workday schedule, and ways to improve the program.
