**A secure messaging platform that enables users to transmit and receive messages through a command-line interface, utilizing RSA key encryption.**

Using the principles of RSA key encryption, I have built a command line application that's built in .NET 6.0. This application facilitates the creation of public and private key pairs and stores them securely within a database. Users can receive public keys from other users and use them to send encrypted messages to each other as well as receive messages from their inbox.
