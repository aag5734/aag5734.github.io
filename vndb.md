**A small application that takes an exisiting VNDB account and returns a list of recommended visual novels based on the user's most enjoyed categories.**

VNDB (short for the visual novel database) is a website where people can search for Japanese visual novels and rate them from a scale of 1-10. Users can also add them to their list of wanted visual novels and more. Since the site doesn't have its own recommender system, a friend and I decided to take initiative. As of now, the app is still very early in development.
